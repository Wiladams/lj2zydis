LuaJIT binding to Zydis - Zyantific disassembly tools

* https://github.com/zyantific/zydis

This binding is fairly complete as it captures all the exported functions, data types, and enums.  The 'WebExample' is taken from the web page of the Zydis github project, and replicates the output almost exactly.  The 'DOSExample' comes from taking a typical DOS Stub from a Portable Executable file.
